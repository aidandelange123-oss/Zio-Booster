# Zio-Booster FPS Booster

Zio-Booster is a modern FPS boosting application that enhances your gaming experience by optimizing system resources and reducing temperatures in the background.

## 🚀 Features

### Core Features
- **Temperature Monitoring**: Continuously monitors system temperature and identifies high-temperature processes
- **Automatic Optimization**: Automatically terminates high-temperature applications to boost FPS
- **Modern UI**: Clean, intuitive interface with real-time system information
- **Safe Process Management**: Protects critical system processes while optimizing performance
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Shows CPU, memory, and temperature statistics
- **Manual Optimization**: One-click manual optimization when needed

### Safety Features
- **Input Validation Safety Feature (Rust)**: Validates all input parameters are within acceptable ranges
- **Resource Limits Enforcement Safety Feature (Rust)**: Prevents resource exhaustion attacks
- **Numeric Overflow Prevention Safety Feature (Rust)**: Protects against numeric overflow vulnerabilities
- **Error Checking Safety Feature (C++)**: Adds comprehensive error checking for system calls
- **Buffer Overflow Prevention Safety Feature (C++)**: Implements bounds checking for arrays and strings
- **Process Validation Safety Feature (C++)**: Validates process IDs and protects critical system processes

## 📋 Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Windows, macOS, or Linux operating system

## 🔧 New Feature Details

### Game Profile Management
- Create custom profiles for different games with specific optimization settings
- Each profile can have different temperature thresholds and optimization behaviors
- Profiles are saved between sessions

### Gaming Mode
- Blocks system notifications during gameplay
- Disables power-saving features temporarily
- Sets high-performance power plan
- Optimizes background services

### Performance Metrics
- Tracks CPU, memory, and temperature trends
- Provides optimization impact analysis
- Historical performance statistics

## 📊 System Information

The UI displays real-time information including:
- CPU usage percentage
- Memory usage percentage
- System temperature (where supported)
- List of processes with temperature scores
- Current optimization status
- Number of optimizations performed
- Gaming mode status

## ⚠️ Safety Features

- Protected critical system processes from termination
- Safeguards against terminating important applications
- Temperature-based scoring to identify problematic processes
- Confirmation prompts for manual actions
