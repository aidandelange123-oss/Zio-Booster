## 📋 Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Windows, macOS, or Linux operating system

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aidandelange123-oss/Zio-Booster.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd Zio-Booster
```

3. Run the start application script:
```bash
python start-application.py
```

### 🔄 Reinstall Git Files

If you need to reset the repository to a clean state (e.g., to fix corrupted files or revert all changes):

**Option 1: Quick Reset (keeps Git history)**
```bash
# Remove all tracked and untracked files except .git
git clean -fdx
git reset --hard HEAD
```

**Option 2: Complete Reinstall (fresh clone)**
```bash
# Delete the .git directory and reinstall
rm -rf .git
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/aidandelange123-oss/Zio-Booster.git
git pull origin main
```

**Option 3: Windows Batch Script**
Create a file named `reset_git.bat` with the following content:
```batch
@echo off
echo Deleting Git files...
rmdir /s /q .git
del /q /s .gitignore
echo Git files deleted. Run 'git clone' again to reinstall.
pause
```

Then run:
```bash
reset_git.bat
git clone https://github.com/aidandelange123-oss/Zio-Booster.git
```

⚠️ **Warning**: These commands will remove all local changes and Git history. Make sure to backup any important data before proceeding.

## 🎮 Usage

### FPS Booster Application
1. Run the application using `python start-application.py`
2. The application will automatically install required dependencies
3. Select a game profile from the dropdown menu (optional)
4. Click "Apply Profile" to use custom optimization settings
5. Click "Enable Gaming Mode" to activate focused gaming mode
6. Click "Start Boosting" to begin automatic optimization
7. Monitor system resources and process temperatures in real-time
8. Use "Manual Optimize" for on-demand optimization
9. Click "Stop Boosting" to pause automatic optimization

### 🎬 Video Browser API Usage

#### Quick Start
Include the video browser API script in your HTML:
```html
<script src="js_features/video-browser-api.js"></script>
```

#### Basic Implementation
```javascript
// Initialize player with default settings
const player = new ZioBoosterPlayer({
  container: '#video-container',
  videoUrl: 'https://example.com/video.mp4',
  watermarkText: 'Zio Booster'
});

// Play video
player.play();

// Pause video
player.pause();

// Change video
player.loadVideo('https://example.com/new-video.mp4');

// Destroy player
player.destroy();
```

#### Advanced Configuration
```javascript
const player = new ZioBoosterPlayer({
  container: '#my-player',
  videoUrl: 'https://example.com/video.mp4',
  
  // Watermark settings
  watermarkText: 'Zio Booster',
  watermarkPosition: 'bottom-right', // top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right, center
  watermarkOpacity: 0.7,
  watermarkColor: '#FFFFFF',
  watermarkFontSize: '24px',
  
  // Player settings
  autoplay: false,
  loop: false,
  muted: false,
  volume: 0.8,
  
  // Event callbacks
  onReady: () => console.log('Player ready'),
  onPlay: () => console.log('Video playing'),
  onPause: () => console.log('Video paused'),
  onEnded: () => console.log('Video ended'),
  onError: (error) => console.error('Error:', error)
});
```

#### Batch Video Loading
```javascript
const videos = [
  'https://example.com/video1.mp4',
  'https://example.com/video2.mp4',
  'https://example.com/video3.mp4'
];

const player = new ZioBoosterPlayer({
  container: '#playlist-player',
  videos: videos,
  watermarkText: 'Zio Booster'
});

// Navigate playlist
player.nextVideo();
player.previousVideo();
```

#### Using the API Helper
```javascript
// Create player with helper function
const player = ZioBoosterAPI.createPlayer('#container', {
  videoUrl: 'https://example.com/video.mp4',
  watermarkText: 'Zio Booster'
});

// Get all active players
const players = ZioBoosterAPI.getAllPlayers();

// Destroy all players
ZioBoosterAPI.destroyAllPlayers();
```
